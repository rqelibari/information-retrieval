# Information Retrieval
Little projects written in C++ for my "information retrieval" class.

## What is Information Retrieval about?
[Information retrieval][1] (IR) as I am learning it is the science about better
filtering. Generally spoken you normally have a (huge) dataset, from which you
want only a subset, which depends on your intention. Google for example has a
billion Websites as its dataset, but only wants the ones, which fit your search
query best. An email application has a lot of emails as its dataset but only
wants to accept non-spam messages.
Retrieving a subset is also known as filtering. So:

> IR enables software to build
this filter by using [metadata][2] which inherently belongs to the dataset.
